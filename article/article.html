                    Your flood damage cover depends upon the type of car insurance plan you have purchased. If you have comprehensive coverage, which is an optional cover, then only the flood damage is covered in your car insurance policy. However, if you have a third-party car insurance policy, you will not receive any financial protection against the flood damages caused to your insured car.
    A comprehensive car insurance policy covers all kinds of damages to your insured car by natural calamities such as cyclones, tides, floods, tsunamis, etc. Moreover, it covers damages sustained by cars due to fire, accidents, theft, and man-made calamities.It is always an ideal choice to go for comprehensive insurance policy if you reside in a flood-prone area.

                    Yes, your comprehensive car insurance policy covers the flood damage. Therefore, it is essential to get adequate coverage for your car. Comprehensive car insurance is the best way to get compensated for flood damages or total loss situations.
